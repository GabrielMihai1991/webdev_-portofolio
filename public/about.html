<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I'm Mihai, a passionate web developer with a love for graphic design and poetry.</p>
<p>As I embark on my web development journey, I find joy in creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I'm not just about code; I'm a visual storyteller who thrives on turning ideas into engaging digital experiences.</p>
<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll often find me lost in graphic design programs, blending creativity with technology. My knack for design adds an extra layer of finesse to my web projects.</p>
<p>Poetry is my other love, and I believe in infusing a touch of artistry into everything I create. Whether it's lines of code or verses of poetry, I strive for elegance and expression in my work.</p>

  Excited to share my coding journey with you!</p>
